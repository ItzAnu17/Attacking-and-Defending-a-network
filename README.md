<h1>Attacking and monitoring a network</h1>


<h2>Description of the Project</h2>
The goal of the project is to create a small network, analyse ICMP and TCP packets which are incoming and ongoing within the network. Later, attack a user’s device and analyse the packets and see any changes from before. And finally, to implement a firewall to prevent TCP and ICMP flooding attack.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Bash</b> 
- <b>Wireshark</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali Linux</b>

A small network was created with 4 users and a switch: <br/>

<br />
Checking if we can ping each other. :  <br/>

<br />
After connecting, we can use iperf on both the host and the client to monitor the
connectivity, recording TCP connection statistics such as Interval, Transfer and
Bandwidth. The command (iperf -s) was used to host a server. The following image
shows 192.168.65.178 (Anaaf) receiving TCP packets which are sent by
192.168.65.61 (Kunhuan): <br/>

ICMP flooding attack.<br/>
Two devices were used to attack a single PC. By using the command “$sudo hping3 -1 -flood 192.168.65.178”:

<br />
<br />
On the host 192.168.65.178, the flow chart in Wireshark shows significant flooded packets
(brown line) coming, compared to those generated by ping (green line).:

<br />
<br />
In Wireshark:  <br/>
The average Packets Per Second (PPS) is 45320.9/s and 70% of the packets were
dropped. It is clear that compared to level 2, there was a huge amount of packets
running.

TCP Flooding Attack:  <br/>
TCP Flooding attack was done in a similar way, the command was “$sudo hping3
192.168.65.178 -S -p 22 --flood”

Firewall for ICMP flooding attack:  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using firewalls are helpful in defending possible network attacks. To block ICMP attacks
we implemented the rules in iptable command. The rules are:
