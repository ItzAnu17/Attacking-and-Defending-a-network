<h1>Attacking and monitoring a network</h1>


<h2>Description of the Project</h2>
The goal of the project is to create a small network, analyse ICMP and TCP packets which are incoming and ongoing within the network. Later, attack a user’s device and analyse the packets and see any changes from before. And finally, to implement a firewall to prevent TCP and ICMP flooding attack.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Bash</b> 
- <b>Wireshark</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali Linux</b>

A small network was created with 4 users and a switch: <br/>

Checking if we can ping each other. :  <br/>

<br />
After connecting, we can use iperf on both the host and the client to monitor the
connectivity, recording TCP connection statistics such as Interval, Transfer and
Bandwidth. The command (iperf -s) was used to host a server. The following image
shows 192.168.65.178 (Anaaf) receiving TCP packets which are sent by
192.168.65.61 (Kunhuan): <br/>

ICMP flooding attack.<br/>
Two devices were used to attack a single PC. By using the command “$sudo hping3 -1 -flood 192.168.65.178”:

<br />
<br />
On the host 192.168.65.178, the flow chart in Wireshark shows significant flooded packets
(brown line) coming, compared to those generated by ping (green line).:

<br />
<br />
In Wireshark:  <br/>
The average Packets Per Second (PPS) is 45320.9/s and 70% of the packets were
dropped. It is clear that compared to level 2, there was a huge amount of packets
running.

<br />
TCP Flooding Attack:  <br/>
TCP Flooding attack was done in a similar way, the command was “$sudo hping3
192.168.65.178 -S -p 22 --flood”

Firewall for ICMP flooding attack:  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using firewalls are helpful in defending possible network attacks. To block ICMP attacks
we implemented the rules in iptable command. The rules are:
<br/>
<br/>

<br />
<br />
These rules will block every incoming ICMP packet from the specified IP addresses and
limit the ICMP packet rate. After we performed an ICMP flooding attack again, “No
response” packets were sniffed, which is different from level 3’s results, so we assume
the firewalls are functioning.  <br/>

<br/>


However, these three images below show the flooding attack still being observed by
Wireshark. Furthermore, it is difficult to see the difference between before and after the
firewall has been implemented, this could be due to:

The explanation is Wireshark captures them before they are dropped by iptables:
We expected that we will not see any ICMP from the attackers IP, however this is not the case. Our assumption is we only have two interfaces here instead of three, so the victim still gets the packets, but no response shows that. The confusing display of captured packets in Wireshark is since both Wireshark and iptables filtering are taking place using the same interface, eth0. An interpretation could be that while Wireshark is aware of the incoming echo_request packets, iptables is dropping these packets, resulting in their absence from the Wireshark capture.

Firewall for TCP flooding attack:  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The rules used in the firewall for this attack::
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The previous ICMP rules were removed, and the new rules added to prevent TCP
Flood attack by limiting the rate and dropping the packets.
After we performed a TCP flooding attack again, the results we got are different from
level3, so the firewall should be working:

However, we still observed the flooding traffic as shown in these following images
when comparing to previous levels.
